# reddit-project

## Aim
Produce and deploy a webpage making use of React-Redux to display user-searchable content from Reddit.  
See exemplar provided by Codecademy [here](https://reddit-client.netlify.app/).  
To create a single page application which:
- as a user will show me a list of subreddits as collected from the Reddit API
- as a user will allow me to choose a subreddit & show me a list of posts from that subreddit
- as a user will allow me to input a search term and display only those posts with the search term in them
- as a user will show me the number of comments on each post and allow me to expand the comments section

## Requirements
Hosted on [netlify](https://gnolandev-reddit-project.netlify.app/).

## Technologies

- ECMAScript 6
- React
- Redux
- CSS
- React Testing Library & msw for api mocking

## Improvements

This application has all the functionality of the exemplar (as the 'voting' buttons don't actually do anything there except look nice!), has fairly comprehensive test coverage & so needs no further work.  It could be improved with styling for better aesthetics, and other features (like working voting buttons, ability to add comments etc) could be added.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
